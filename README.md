Erlang on the JVM

## Goal

This project aims to implement Erlang on the JVM.

### What is wrong with [erjang](https://github.com/trifork/erjang)?

Nothing.
It is a great project, which actually is able to run Erlang on the JVM, but it also has some flaws:

* Development seems to be stopped in mid-2014 (please correct if this is wrong).
* Supported OTP version is R16B01, but Erlang/OTP is at 18.0
* Build is too complicated (uses e.g. ant and perl)
* Does not support Java 8
